a pi0 video-instrument designed for diy soldering workshops

## brainstorm

the finished repo may not be here - this is just a placeholder for brainstorming

## goal

to design a 'lite' version of r_e_c_u_r (raspberry pi based video-sampler) that can be built from a kit in a group workshop for under 30euro per unit

### hardware

currently i am thinking of using :

- [raspberry pi zero] - 5euro
- custom pcb 100x100mm - 1.8euro
- [smaller screen (1.8"?)] - 3.5euro
- [push buttons + caps from china] - ~ 1euro for 10-12 per unit

- 4 pots for analog input - 3euro from tayda (less if from china)
- 4 [thonkicon jack] inputs - 1.5euro 
- [a2d (mcp3008) from china] - 2euro

- few resistors + diodes
- few pin headers
- a composite video jack
- sd card
- power-adapter

- (maybe) raspi0 camera clone ?
