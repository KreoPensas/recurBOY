# recurboy default_panel notes

- the mounting holes fit m3 screws
- the front_panel mounts to pcb with 10mm standoffs
- 40mm screws will fit front_panel, pcb, pi0 and back_plate
- the default potentiometers in underscores BOMs have 12mm shaft lengths - consider replacing these with >17mm shaft length alternatives if you plan to use it with a panel
