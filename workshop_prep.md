i just want to start some notes to keep track and plan for the first recurBOY workshop in OCTOBER. this is a little over 8 weeks from now. this is plently of time to get code working but not much room for wiggle if sourcing parts and pcbs cheaply from china.

for aliexpress parts it would be best to allow 5-6weeks max - although most get here faster you never know. for ciruit-boards, cheap from seeed should take max 4 weeks - this is the biggest risk as i dont know how many revisions i might need. prioty circuits arrive within a week but cost MUCH MUCH more maybe 4x the price or more.

for ali-express some parts i can order now, some need to be tested first - i should try to do these asap
given the ali-parts are confirmed the next step is to get started on the circuit board to allow time for revisions - even if the software is not finished need to start with hardware - i want to aim to have first revision send away in less than 2 weeks from now - maybe try to do it this weekend

ofcourse if needed i can pay more to get things faster closer to the deadline - i would like to have decided a cutoff date early so i know when to act fast.

a table of parts ordered, tested, recieved etc to come here soon plus more dates and deadlines tbc
